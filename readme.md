## Description

Hide and Seek gamemode for [GTA](https://www.rockstargames.com/V/) [FiveM](https://fivem.net/).

One player is randomly choosen to act as the **Seeker**. They will have a police car and must look throughout a designated area for players on the **Hidden** team.

Once found, a player will join the Seeking team and assist the starting Seeker.
